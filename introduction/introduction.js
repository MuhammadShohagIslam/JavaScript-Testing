/*
    *** JavaScript Testing ***
        => It's typicaly means that we want to verify whether something
        works as intended.
        => When writing software or building websites, then we
         typically want to test whether that software or that website 
         we are building is working the way we expect it to work.

/*
    *** Two way test of out Software ***
        --- Manual Testing ---
            => Tedious and cumbersome
            => Error-prone
            => Often incomplete (not all scenarios covered)

        --- Automated Testing ---
            => Write your code then test your code
            => inital effort (write tests), no effort thereafter
            => Predictable and consistent
            => High / complete code and scenario coverage can achieved.

/*
        *** Different kind of Automate Testing ***
                --- Unit Testing ---
            => A building block of our app
            => Ideally, the smallest possibile building block
            => eg. function, a class, a component.

        *Application made up with all of the Unit*
            => App = combination of all units
                => If all units were tested, the overall app should work -> Backed up by integration tests
                => changes are always tested against all units to avoid bugs.

        *** Why Unit Testing ***
            => Avoids endless amount of manual testing
            => Allows we to cover(close to) 100% of our code and scenarios
            => code changes are tested against all scenarios almost instantly
            => Write cleaner and better code (beacuse testing then becomes easier)
